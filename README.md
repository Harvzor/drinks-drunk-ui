# Scrobbler UI

## Requirements

- `typescript` version 3.7 or later for [optional chaining](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html)

## Getting started with development

1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`

## Building

1. `npm run build`

## Environment variables

This guide was mostly followed: https://github.com/kunokdev/cra-runtime-environment-variables

When you first run `npm start`, it will run `env.sh` which will create an `env-config.js` (by reading env vars). This file is retrievable by the FE.
